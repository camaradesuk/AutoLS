# AutoLS
AutoLS is an online tool to identify and retrieve full text PDFs of studies from different biomedical databases, specifically, the indexed database PubMed, the preprint server BioRxiv and APIs. Identifying studies from across different databases is an essential step when conducting systematic literature reviews to guarantee adequate and efficient coverage. A search strategy should balance precision and sensitivity. To conduct a living review it is necessary to run this search at regular intervals. 

Currently, AutoLS is available as raw R code. and as an R Shiny application. We will create an R package for wider dissemination and use and plug this tool into an automated workflow.

# AutoLS
AutoLSâ€¯is an online tool to identify and retrieve study references from different biomedical databases, specifically, the indexed database PubMed, the preprint server BioRxiv and APIs. Identifying studies from across different databases is an essential step when conducting systematic literature reviews to guarantee adequate and efficient coverage. A search strategy should balance precision and sensitivity. To conduct a living review, it is necessary to run this search at regular intervals. 

AutoLS is available as an independently deployable GitHub project. It is written using .NET framework and C# language. It can be used as a microservice endpoint with any other microservices side by side and any other biomedical database API.
